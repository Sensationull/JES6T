A repo that tests your ES6 knowledge

This project was designed to test your knowledge of a variety of ES6 concepts you may or may not be familiar with. Included:

FAT ARROWS (Arrow Functions)
CURLY BRACES (Object Destructuring)
SOME ELLIPSES (Rest Parameters)
DEFAULTY THINGS (Default Parameters)
JQUERY-LOOKING THINGS (Template Literals)
THOSE OTHER LOOPS (for...of loops)

For those people who don't know how these things work. This is a test suite with examples and tests to help you get in the swing of using some ES6+ features. It's mostly pretty simple, but I'll be adding more and more tests as time goes on.

If you were curious how these things work and maybe take a sneak peek at Jest as well, well look here.
