Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

A repo that tests your ES6 knowledge

This project was designed to test your knowledge of a variety of ES6 concepts you may or may not be familiar with. Included:

FAT ARROWS (Arrow Functions)
CURLY BRACES (Object Destructuring)
SOME ELLIPSES (Rest Parameters)
DEFAULTY THINGS (Default Parameters)
JQUERY-LOOKING THINGS (Template Literals)
THOSE OTHER LOOPS (for...of loops)

Problem
For those people who don't know how these things work.

Solution
If you were curious how these things work and maybe take a sneak peek at Jest as well, well look here.

Quote from You
If you turn off the linter, I'll cut you.

How to Get Started
Fork it, clone it, npm install, run build, start it and then localhost it. 
it's like 2 minutes.
unless you forget the step I left out.

If this breaks your machine, that's on you.
