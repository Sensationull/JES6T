# JES6T

A repo that guides you through ES6 changes

This project was designed to test your knowledge of a variety of ES6 concepts you may or may not be familiar with. Included:

FAT ARROWS (Arrow Functions)
CURLY BRACES (Object Destructuring)
SOME ELLIPSES (Rest Parameters)
DEFAULTY THINGS (Default Parameters)
JQUERY-LOOKING THINGS (Template Literals)
THOSE OTHER LOOPS (for...of loops)

For those people who don't know how these things work. This is a test suite with examples and tests to help you get in the swing of using some ES6+ features. It's mostly pretty simple, but I'll be adding more and more tests as time goes on.

If you were curious how these things work and maybe take a sneak peek at Jest as well, well look here.

How to Get Started
npm install it then guide yourself through to the tests portion of repo and go through each non test.js file. When you've finished that module run `npm run test` to see if all the tests are passing
